# Liberty Framework
This public repository contains all the files needed for the deployment

Liberty Framework is a no-code development platform built with cutting-edge technologies such as React, Node.js, and PostgreSQL. This framework includes essential management tools like Traefik, Rundeck, and PgAdmin, allowing you to create web applications in no time, without the need for coding skills.

Liberty Framework also features a native connector for JD Edwards, enabling efficient management of access rights, task segregation, and Oracle license compliance. With its modern architecture, it provides a comprehensive solution to design robust applications in record time.

# Liberty Framework Services Documentation 🚀

This document provides an overview of the functionality and configuration of the services within the Liberty Framework, including Node.js, PostgreSQL, pgAdmin, Rundeck, OIDC, and Filebrowser. These services are integrated with Traefik as a reverse proxy, enabling both HTTP and HTTPS access with automated routing.

1. Node.js Service (liberty-node) 🟢

	•	Image: ghcr.io/fblettner/liberty-node:latest

	•	Security Options:
	•	🔒 label:disable: Disables SELinux labels.
	•	⚙️ cap_drop: Removes unnecessary Linux capabilities like MKNOD and AUDIT_WRITE.
	•	Networks: Connected to the liberty-network.
	•	Working Directory: /opt/liberty
	•	Depends on: PostgreSQL (pg) service.
	•	Traefik Configuration:
	•	🌐 API Routing: HTTP and HTTPS routing for /api using PathPrefix.
	•	📡 Socket Routing: HTTP and HTTPS routing for /socket and /socket.io.
	•	⚛️ React Application: Handles HTTP and HTTPS routing for the React app with a middleware for error pages.
	•	🚀 Compression: compress-middleware applied to several routes for better performance.
	•	🔌 Port Configuration: Node.js runs on port 3002.

2. PostgreSQL Service (liberty-pg) 🐘

	•	Image: ghcr.io/fblettner/liberty-pg:latest
	•	Command: Runs the PostgreSQL server with optimized settings for performance:
	•	shared_buffers=2GB
	•	track_activity_query_size=1MB
	•	work_mem=256MB
	•	maintenance_work_mem=128MB
	•	Other configurations to optimize WAL size, checkpoint timing, and costs.
	•	Volumes: Data stored in the pg-data volume.
	•	Networks: Connected to liberty-network.
	•	Traefik Configuration:
	•	🛠️ TCP Router: Routes PostgreSQL traffic via db entry point.

3. pgAdmin Service (liberty-pgadmin) 🖥️

	•	Image: ghcr.io/fblettner/liberty-pgadmin:latest
	•	User: Root privileges enabled.
	•	Volumes: pgAdmin data stored in the pgadmin-data volume.
	•	Environment: Sets the SCRIPT_NAME=/pgadmin for pgAdmin web access.
	•	Depends on: PostgreSQL (pg).
	•	Networks: Connected to liberty-network.
	•	Traefik Configuration:
	•	🌐 HTTP Router: Routes requests for /pgadmin.
	•	🔌 Port: Exposed on port 3003.

4. Rundeck Service (liberty-rundeck) 🛠️

	•	Image: ghcr.io/fblettner/liberty-rundeck:latest
	•	Security Options:
	•	🔒 Disables SELinux labels.
	•	⚙️ Drops capabilities MKNOD and AUDIT_WRITE.

5. OIDC Service (liberty-keycloak) 🔐

	•	Image: ghcr.io/fblettner/liberty-keycloak:latest
	•	Command: Starts the Keycloak OIDC server with proxy headers and hostname settings.
	•	Environment Variables:
	•	🔄 PROXY_ADDRESS_FORWARDING: Enables proxy address forwarding.
	•	🌍 KC_HOSTNAME_PATH and KC_HTTP_RELATIVE_PATH: Configured to /oidc.
